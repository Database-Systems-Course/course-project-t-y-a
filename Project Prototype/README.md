Database Project Prototype

Add Project Application Prototype in this folder

Notes:
These forms are currently not linked because the login form will redirect the user according to the category he/she belongs to, that we can do once we have the IDs and user names segregated according to student,faculty and staff. 
Every member of our group has made their respective forms and uploaded. Once we have the data ready and the front end and back end connected then we would link all these forms together.

Change log:

Date: 22/11/2019
-- The faculty and student forms have been updated as per your feedback in the last class.
-- The staff forms are in progress.
